# SPAM OR HAM CLASSIFICATION OF MAILS

In this project I perform NLP implementation on a spam.csv file to classify whether the mail is spam or not. I make us of NLP basic techniques for data preprocessing and classical machine learning techniques for model training.

You can find the spam dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset

In the Jupyter file further explanation of the project is given.
